Easy to use and data is displaying correctly. However, when trying to delete an element on the main form after already attempting to delete an element on the "Show Details" form, it crashes. It may be the case that data is being  modified on the adapter but not the underlying database. Minor issue, otherwise everything else seemed to work well. In the code, good use of comments. Great job overall.
